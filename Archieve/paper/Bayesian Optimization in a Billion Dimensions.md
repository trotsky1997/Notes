      # Bayesian Optimization in a Billion Dimensions via Random Embeddings
  
      ## TLDR
      We introduce REMBO, a novel algorithm that can optimize black-box functions with low effective dimensionality in very high-dimensional spaces.
  
      ## Motivation
      Bayesian optimization is a powerful technique for finding the global optimum of expensive black-box functions, but it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Many real-world problems, however, have low effective dimensionality, meaning that the function does not change significantly along some directions. We aim to exploit this property and scale Bayesian optimization to arbitrary high dimensions.
  
      ## Related Works
      - Bergstra et al. (2011) proposed a tree-based Parzen estimator for high-dimensional optimization, but it relies on weak uncertainty estimates and lacks theoretical guarantees.
      - Hutter et al. (2011) used random forest models for Bayesian optimization, but they also suffer from poor uncertainty estimates and convergence properties.
      - Carpentier and Munos (2012) proposed a compressed sensing strategy for linear bandits with sparse features, but it does not apply to nonlinear functions[2].
      - Chen et al. (2012) proposed a two-stage strategy for variable selection and optimization of high-dimensional Gaussian processes, but it requires the effective dimensions to be axis-aligned and provides empirical results only for synthetic examples[3].
      - Bergstra and Bengio (2012) proposed random search as a simple baseline for optimization with low effective dimensionality, but it does not exploit any prior information or feedback[4].
  
      ## Method
      - We define the effective dimensionality of a function as the smallest dimension of a linear subspace that contains the optimum.
      - We propose REMBO, a random embedding Bayesian optimization algorithm that maps a low-dimensional space to a high-dimensional space using a random matrix and performs Bayesian optimization in the low-dimensional space.
      - We use Gaussian processes as our prior model and expected improvement as our acquisition function. We also use projection and hyper-parameter optimization techniques to handle box constraints and kernel selection.
      - We prove that REMBO can find the optimum with high probability if the function has low effective dimensionality, regardless of the extrinsic dimensionality.

        # f: black-box function to optimize

            x_best = x
            f_best = f_x

      ```
  
      ## Experiment Setup
  
      - We use synthetic functions of low effective dimensionality (de = 2) embedded in high extrinsic dimensions (D up to 10^9).
      - We compare REMBO to standard Bayesian optimization (BO), random search (RANDOM), and the method by Chen et al. (2012) (HD BO)[8].
      - We measure the performance by the optimality gap: the difference between the best function value found and the global optimum[9].
      - We run each method for 500 function evaluations and repeat each experiment for 50 trials.
  
      | Method | D = 25 | D = 25 (rotated) | D = 10^9 |
      | ------ | ------ | ---------------- | -------- |
      | REMBO  | 0.0001 | 0.0001           | 0.0001   |
      | BO     | 0.7406 | 1.8996           | N/A      |
      | RANDOM | 0.7406 | 0.7406           | 0.7406   |
      | HD BO  | 0.0143 | 0.4865           | N/A      |
  
      ## Innovation
      - We introduce a novel random embedding idea to scale Bayesian optimization to arbitrary high dimensions, provided the function has low effective dimensionality[11].
      - We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm.
      - We demonstrate that our algorithm can optimize functions in up to a billion dimensions, which is unprecedented in the literature.
  
      ## Core Advantage
      - Our algorithm is simple, easy to implement, and does not require any problem-specific knowledge or tuning.
      - Our algorithm is invariant to rotations and can handle any linear subspace of low effective dimensionality, unlike existing methods that rely on axis-aligned dimensions.
      - Our algorithm can handle both continuous and discrete variables by using a suitable kernel function and projection technique.
  
      ## Improvements
      - We improve over random search by exploiting the prior information and feedback from the black-box function using Gaussian processes.
      - We improve over standard Bayesian optimization by reducing the dimensionality of the search space using random embeddings.
      - We improve over the method by Chen et al. (2012) by avoiding the need for variable selection and sequential testing, and by being more robust to rotations.
  
      ## Limitations
      - Our algorithm relies on the assumption that the function has low effective dimensionality, which may not hold for some problems.
      - Our algorithm requires choosing the dimension and the region of the low-dimensional space, which may affect its performance and success rate.
      - Our algorithm does not provide any theoretical guarantees on the convergence rate or the regret bound.
  
      ## Future Work
      - We plan to extend our algorithm to handle non-linear embeddings and non-stationary kernels, which may capture more complex structures of the function.
      - We plan to develop more adaptive and data-driven methods for choosing the dimension and the region of the low-dimensional space, which may improve its efficiency and robustness.
      - We plan to investigate more rigorous theoretical analysis of our algorithm, such as deriving convergence rates or regret bounds under some mild assumptions.
  
      ## Overlooked Details
      - One subtle insight of our algorithm is that it exploits the rotational invariance of Gaussian matrices, which ensures that the random embedding preserves the effective subspace with high probability.
      - Another subtle insight of our algorithm is that it uses projection and hyper-parameter optimization techniques to handle box constraints and kernel selection, which are often ignored or fixed in standard Bayesian optimization.
      - A third subtle insight of our algorithm is that it interleaves multiple runs with different random embeddings, which increases its success rate exponentially and allows parallelization.
  
      ## Surpassing Challenges
      - One difficulty for others to exceed our work is to find a more general and principled way of defining and exploiting the effective dimensionality of a function, which may not be linear or constant.
      - Another difficulty for others to exceed our work is to find a more efficient and reliable way of optimizing the acquisition function in the low-dimensional space, which may be noisy or multimodal.
      - A third difficulty for others to exceed our work is to find a more scalable and flexible way of modeling the black-box function in the high-dimensional space, which may be non-smooth or non-Gaussian.
  
      ## Inspiration
      - The likely thought process and motivations of the authors are as follows:
          - We observed that many real-world problems have low effective dimensionality, meaning that only a few dimensions affect the function significantly.
          - We wondered if we could exploit this property and scale Bayesian optimization to very high dimensions, where standard methods fail or become inefficient.
          - We came up with the idea of using random embeddings to map a low-dimensional space to a high-dimensional space, and perform Bayesian optimization in the low-dimensional space.
          - We analyzed the theoretical properties and empirical performance of our algorithm, and compared it with existing methods on synthetic and real-world problems.
  
      ## Beyond Ideas
      - Some important learnings beyond core techniques are as follows:
          - We learned how to use random matrices and projections as powerful tools for dimensionality reduction and optimization.
          - We learned how to use Gaussian processes and acquisition functions as flexible and effective models for Bayesian optimization.
          - We learned how to design simple and robust algorithms that can handle various types of variables and constraints.
  
      ## Unfamiliar Terms
      - Some clear explanations of top-3 key technical concepts are as follows:
          - Effective dimensionality: The smallest number of dimensions that contain the global optimum of a function. For example, if a function does not change along some directions, then those directions are not part of its effective dimensionality.
          
              

- Random embedding: A linear transformation that maps a low-dimensional space to a high-dimensional space using a random matrix. For example, if A is a D x d random matrix, then y = A @ x is a random embedding of x in R^d to y in R^D.
- Acquisition function: A function that measures the expected utility of querying a point in the search space. For example, expected improvement is an acquisition function that quantifies the improvement over the current best function value.
